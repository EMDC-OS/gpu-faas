Updated works
- Docker run execution path with more detail path analysis
-- Make "runc", "docker" binary for get timestamp and future analysis
--- Codes are on binary_hijacking directory
-- Main delay come frome "docker pull" (~2.5sec)
-- Cold start (at docker run ~ function result return) main delay is RunC create ~ RunC start (~300ms)

Future works
- Find "runc" command caller path on containerd-shim or containerd
- "docker pull" path analysis is necessary? (Determine where to start)
- "docker run" path analysis is necessary?
- Memory usage on each path as many as possible
