Progress

- Drop Memory Management for Serverless Computing
-- Get OpenWhisk function invoke path and GPU-runtime assign at "runc create" with 130ms more additional overhead

- GPU-support serverless computing
-- MIG configuration clear and baseline measurement done (PolyBench)
--- Without MIG / 7g / 4g / 3g / 2g / 1g
--- API initialization time decreased on smaller GI
--- Memory initialization time decreased on smaller GI (but Without -> 7g increased)
--- Total initialization time decreased
--- Kernel execution time is varied maybe because of grid configuration? (always increased, decreased / decreased to increased)
-- Major point divided as two: Latency/Throughput

# Latency
- Main design key point is sharing GPU context
- Previous work, Only new task which created from parent with CLONE_THREAD flags can share GPU context
- I think I have to check do_fork function's CLONE_THREAD part
- Maybe key is PID and Memory sharing

# Througput
- Now, no idea...
- Summarize read papers again and gather more papers
