Progress
- Thoughput measurement script has problem
-- Not consider memory size (Have to use producer-consumer type function generation using python or etc..)

- MIG measurement
-- No initialization time difference when
--- Single GI at multiple CI type
--- Multiple same GI type
--- Multiple different GI type (Today to do, maybe depends on GI type)

- Latency-reduced function launch (Zero-init launch)
-- Using shared library with dynamic linking API (dlsym)
-- Successfully reduced initialization overhead
-- Have to check CUDA kernel works well (Only check initialization time)

- Throughput-maximized function launch (function-aware launch)
-- Consider design...
