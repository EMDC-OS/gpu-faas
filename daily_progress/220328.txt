Progress
- Baseline throughput measurement
-- Request queue based measurement (Defining queue size and Total number of request)
-- Throughput = Total number of request / Total request execution time
-- Check it on the native server but cannot measure using OpenWhisk because of configuration issue
--- In OpenWhisk, change ansible/group_vars/all: invocationsPerMinutes (default 60 -> 600), but not changed when execution

- After this week meeting, OpenWhisk modification for Zero-Init launching will be start

- Have to read papers and find methodologies related to snapshot-based launching
