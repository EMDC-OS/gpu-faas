Progress
- OpenWhisk actionproxy.py prototype modification done
-- Change init,run phase to use dynamic library (subprocess -> ctypes)
-- For just launching without GPU init, output of function set as init time on function
--- Cannot read stdout of dynamic library's as variable on python (not resolved now)
(Working well at toy code)

To Do
- Make PolyBench to test using zero-init prototype
- Throughput measurement
