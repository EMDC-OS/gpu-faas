Progress (0418 workshop, 0419 Meeting summary)
- 0418
-- GPU context sharing can occur security problem for residual of previous function's resource
--- 1. We cannot modify GPU's internal resources using code directly, also only single function use single context at same time (no time-sharing)
--- 2. By adopting 0419 meeting's todo concept in GPU it does not matter for no time-sharing domain
- 0419
-- Make new process for function execution
--- Share process with web server can be violated isolation
-- Using same process for next request can be violated isolation
--- Residual resource (like writtable area or files used by previous request)
-- New concept added (REWIND, name can be changed later)
--- Roll back system resources to before function launched status
--- Reuse read-only resources (resources that does not violate isolation)

Procedure example
1. Cold start request
2. Create container and launch web server, main process
3. Create GPU context and dynamic library that contain function loading
4. Save current status
5. Function launch (can reduce GPU context creation overhead - MAX 90% of function)
6. Roll-back to saved status but not roll-back some resources that does not violated isolation
7. Container paused
....
8. Warm start request
9. Container unpaused
10. Save current status
11. Function launch with reuse some resources (can reduce some resource creation overhead without violate isolation)
12. Roll-back to saved status but not roll-back some resources that does not violated isolation
13. Container paused
....
