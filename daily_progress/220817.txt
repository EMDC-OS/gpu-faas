Progress
- Workload implementation
-- Workload 1 ~ 9 (r740_files/REWIND_Bench)
--- Heavy library test, Simple computation, S3, Image processing, Zip
- REWIND
-- Lib-based launching can eliminate function-dependent resource allocation time (e.g., library)
-- But, it could have security issue (different user reuse container)
-- REWIND the system resources for reducing function execution time and guarantee resource isolation
-- Implementation
--- File system rewinder
---- proto type implementation & simple test on container done (r740_files/fs_rewind/fs_rewind.py)
